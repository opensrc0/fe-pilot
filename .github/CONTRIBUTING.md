Thanks for showing interest to contribute to FE-Pilot...!

## Setup the Project
[Setup fe-pilot locally on your machine and use in the your project](SETUP.md)

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. FE-Pilot
uses a monorepo structure and we treat each component as an independent package
that can be consumed in isolation.

### Tooling

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) to manage packages and dependencies

### Commands

**`pnpm install`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.


## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox
link.

You may wish to use our starters to help you get going:

- JavaScript Starter: https://codesandbox.io/s/fe-pilotJS
- TypeScript Starter: https://codesandbox.io/s/fe-pilotTs

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.
